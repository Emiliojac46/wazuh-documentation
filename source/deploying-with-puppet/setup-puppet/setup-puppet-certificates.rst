Setting up Puppet certificates
=================================

1 - Run in your Puppet agent to generate a certificate for the Puppet Server to sign:

.. code-block:: console

   # /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent -t

.. note:: 

   You will see a message like this:  ``Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled``

2 - Log into to your Puppet Server, and list the certificates that need approval:

.. code-block:: console

   # /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list

It should output a list with your nodeâ€™s hostname.

3 - Approve the certificate, replacing ``hostname.example.com`` with your agent's node name:

.. code-block:: console

   # /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign hostname.example.com

4 - Back on the Puppet agent node, run the puppet agent again:

.. code-block:: console

   # /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent -t

.. note:: Remember that private network DNS is a prerequisite for a successful certificate signing.
